            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Business Loan EMI Calculation Formula</h2>
            <p>The formula that Urban Money Business Loan EMI Calculator uses is as follows:<br/><span className="fontBold">{`EMI = P x R x (1 + R) ^ T / {(1 + R ) ^ T - 1}`}</span></p>
            <p>Here:</p>
            <ul className="oList blueList listSpanbold mb20">
              <li>The Principal Amount is denoted by the variable P.</li>
              <li>The rate of interest is represented by the variable R.</li>
              <li>The tenure of the loan duration is denoted by the variable T.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The symbol ^ denotes the exponential function read as &quot;raised to&quot;.</p>
            <p>Let&apos;s understand the given formula with the following example. If an entity took a business loan of INR 2.5 Lakh for a period of 2 years with an interest rate of 18% p.a., the EMI would be calculated as follows:</p>
            <p>Principal amount (P)= INR 2.5 lakh<br />Rate of Interest (R)= 18%<br />Tenure (T)= 2 years</p>
            <p>Calculations based on the formula will be:<br />{`P x R x (1 + R) ^ T / {(1 + R) ^ T - 1}`}<br />{`2,50,000 x 18% x (1 + 18%) ^2 / {(1 + 18 %) ^ 2 - 1}`}</p>
            <p>The monthly EMI for a business loan of INR 2.5 lakh will be INR 12,481.</p>

            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">What are the Factors Affecting Business Loan EMI?</h2>
            <p>There are majorly three factors that affect a business loan EMI, namely the principal loan amount, interest rate, and tenure.</p>
            <h3>Principal Loan Amount</h3>
            <p>The principal loan amount is the desired amount borrowed from the banks. These amounts are sanctioned based on the borrowers eligibility. These eligibility factors are usually based on the borrower&apos;s creditworthiness, their repaying capacity, their performance as a company, professional experience in years, etc.</p>
            <h3>Interest Rates</h3>
            <p>Interest rates fluctuate depending on several factors, like government policies, demand, competition, etc. Banks usually have differing interest rates merged with several other offers. It is, therefore, advised that applicants cross-check each bank and pick the loan offer that best suits them.</p>
            <h3>Tenure</h3>
            <p>Tenure is another factor that will affect the EMI calculated on business loans. The thumb rule is that the more the tenure, the less will be the monthly EMI. However, it should be noted that the total repayment amount also exceeds with a longer tenure.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Comparison of Business Loans offered by Various Banks/NBFCs</h2>
            <p>Various top banks and NBFCs provide business loans at reasonable interest rates against flexible tenures. Based on individual requirements, companies can approach these banks for a business loan that would suit their needs. But it is always advised to check the eligibility beforehand via the Urban Money Business Loan Eligibility Calculator. </p>
