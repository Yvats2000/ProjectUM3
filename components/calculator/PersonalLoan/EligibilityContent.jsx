              <p>A personal loan can be defined as an unsecured loan that can be availed to meet a number of end-use requirements and comes with little to no restrictions. Since it is not a guaranteed loan, the lenders face a higher risk factor as compared to other secured loan products. This means, there are numerous factors and parameters that banks and financial institutions consider before determining the applicant’s loan eligibility. With the Urban Money Personal Loan Eligibility Calculator you can understand your eligibility for a loan depending on your income and repayment capacity. This powerful AI-backed calculator considers several factors like credit history, income, employer, existing financial liabilities, etc to bring you the best loan offers suited to your needs.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Personal Loan Eligibility Calculation Formula</h2>
            <p>Different lenders and loan providers calculate your personal loan eligibility based on differing factors. Given below are the two most common methods used to calculate an applicant’s personal loan eligibility:</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Method 1: Multiplier Formula</h2>
            <p>The personal loan eligibility is calculated in this method by using a simple mathematical formula:</p>
            <p className="fontBold">Personal Loan Eligibility = (Applicant’s Salary) x (number between 9 and 18)</p>
            <p>Banks and other financial institutions assign every applicant a multiplier number that ranges from 9 to 18. This number is a rating that reflects your credit profile, income, and the company you work at.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Method 2: Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio</h2>
            <p>This method is usually used by lenders to gauge the applicant’s repayment ability. They take into consideration any of your previous fixed obligations like EMIs, and deduct it from your monthly income. Given below is the formula to calculate eligibility based on this method:</p>
            <p className="fontBold">FOIR = (Total Existing Obligations/Monthly Salary) x 100</p>
            <p>Let’s take a look at an example to understand this concept a little better:</p>
            <p>Suppose your monthly income is Rs. 70,000, and you have existing liabilities like:</p>
            <ul className="oList blueList listSpanbold mb20">
              <li>Personal loan monthly payments of Rs. 6,000.</li>
              <li>Car loan monthly payments of Rs. 9,000.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To calculate the repayment ability of the applicant, lenders consider that they can only use 50% of their income towards repayment of debt. So in this scenario, the amount considered will be Rs. 35,000.</p>
            <p>Total Debts = 9000 + 6000<br />=  Rs. 15,000</p>
            <p>Disposable income for new loan = 50% of monthly income - total existing liabilities <br />=  Rs. 35,000 - Rs. 15,000<br /> = Rs. 20,000</p>
            <p><span className="fontBold">FOIR</span> = (15,000/70,000) * 100<br />= 21%</p>
            <p>In such cases, if the EMI for the new loan exceeds Rs. 20,000 per month even for the longest tenure, your loan application will not be approved. But if the new loan EMI is less than Rs. 20,000, your application will get approved.</p>

            <p>While different lenders might look at different criteria while deciding your loan eligibility, there are a few key common factors that all lenders consider. In this section we will take a look at some of the factors that affect your personal loan eligibility:</p>
            <ul className="oList blueList listSpanbold mb20">
              <li><span className="fontBold">Credit Score:</span> Any credit score of over 750 is considered to be a healthy indication of a borrower’s repayment ability. Applicant’s with a score lower than 750 can also be approved for a loan, but they might get higher interest rates. The closer your score is to 900, the better are your chances of getting a loan approved on your preferred terms. </li>
              <li><span className="fontBold">Employer Reputation and Employment Type:</span> Banks and other loan providers sanction loans easily to salaried employees engaged in the private sector, government sector, or MNCs. Personal loans are also sanctioned to self-employed professionals like architects, doctors, businessmen, doctors, etc. Generally, individuals who are employed in reputable organisations with a decent work history are easily sanctioned loans on their preferred terms.</li>
              <li><span className="fontBold">Applicant’s Age:</span> While most lenders and financial institutions consider 65 years to be the maximum age to sanction a loan. Personal loans are more easily offered to applicants between the ages of 21 years and 60 years. Pensioner’s are also usually sanctioned pension loans with terms that vary from normal personal loans.</li>
              <li><span className="fontBold">Monthly Income:</span> Most banks sanction a personal loan to salaried employees, with a minimum monthly salary of Rs. 15,000.  However, most lenders easily issue loans to an applicant who has a minimum salary of Rs. 25,000. The minimum salary requirement for self-employed persons is at least Rs. 5 lakhs per annum.</li>
              <li><span className="fontBold">Work Experience:</span> Most lenders and financial institutions require their applicants to have a total work experience of 2 years, with 6 months or more in the current organisation. In the case of self-employed applicants, they need to be in their current business for at least 2 years to be eligible for a personal loan.</li>
