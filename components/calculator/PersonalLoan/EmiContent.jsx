            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Personal Loan EMI: A Generic Overview</h2>
            <p>You can easily get a personal loan from a bank or NBFC without pledging collateral. A personal loan comes in handy when you&apos;re planning a vacation, upgrading your home, or preparing a dream wedding.</p>
            <p>You don&apos;t have to put off anything on your bucket list any longer! The end use of the borrowed funds is not restricted. You are free to use the amount to fulfil your financial obligations. You are bound to repay the loan amount in specified tenure ranging from one to five years. </p>
            <p>The fixed amount of money you repay the bank throughout the loan tenure is termed as personal loan EMIs. People usually prefer a personal loan contrary to other loans as it is collateral-free, requires minimal documentation and comes with usage flexibility.</p>
            <p>P denotes the principal amount or loan amount, R is the rate of interest, and N represents the number of monthly instalments.</p>
            <p>As you have to pay the loan EMIs on a monthly basis, the loan tenure is computed in months. Let&apos;s say Person A took a personal loan of INR 10 lakh at a 15 percent interest rate with a repayment tenure of 2 years.</p>
            <p>As per the specifics, P will be INR 10 lakh, R will be 15%, and N will be 24 months. The EMI calculation will go like this.</p>
            <p><span className="fontBold">INR 10,00,000 x 15/100/12 x (1+15/100/12)^24] / [(1+15/100/12)^24-1</span><br /><span className="fontBold">EMI = INR 48,487</span><br />Thus, the monthly EMI will be equal to <span className="fontBold">INR 48,487</span>.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Factors Affecting Personal Loan EMIs</h2>
            <p>The personal loan EMI calculator computes the monthly instalments based on three components, i.e., loan amount, interest rate, and tenure.</p>
            <p>These play a vital role as they highly influence the loan EMIs. Each component is interrelated and affects the other in a significant way.</p>
            <p>For instance, credit score determines the eligibility and interest rate, which further accounts for a major part of your monthly payment amount.</p>
            <p>The following factors affect the personal loan EMI calculation:</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Loan Amount</h2>
            <p>A higher principal amount will result in higher monthly instalments. To determine the maximum amount that can be sanctioned to the borrower, the lender evaluates the former&apos;s financial profile.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Interest Rates</h2>
            <p>Interest rate fluctuations are one of the key influential factors impacting home loan EMIs. It is specifically prominent in the case of floating interest rates, as altering interest rates can create either positive or negative impacts on personal loan EMI. Personal loan interest rates usually fluctuate because of RBI policies and changing international market trends. Higher interest rate results in increased EMI and vice versa.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Repayment Tenure</h2>
            <p>The exact figure of the monthly payable amount is determined based on the repayment time frame of the personal loan. Any change in the loan tenure affects the imposed EMI. The key rule is the EMI amount decreases with increasing tenure and vice versa.</p>
            <p>In addition to the mentioned key factors, several additional pointers can impact the monthly EMIs, including income, investment statements, stable employment history, debt-to-income ratio and credit score.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Benefits of a Personal Loan EMI Calculator</h2>
