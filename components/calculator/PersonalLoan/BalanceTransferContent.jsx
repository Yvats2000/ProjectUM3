          <p>Compare interest rates and save a handsome amount before transferring your loan balance from one bank to another using a personal loan balance transfer calculator.</p>
            <p>A personal loan balance transfer is a cost-effective process where you can transfer your current outstanding loan amount from one lender to a new one, offering you the lowest interest rate without extending your tenure. That way, you pay less EMI amounts every month and save more. However, for a personal loan balance transfer, you might have to pay a processing fee and stamp duty charges imposed by your lender.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Personal Loan Balance Transfer</h2>
            <p>To reduce the EMI burden, you can go for a personal loan balance transfer. This facility will help you pay EMIs at a lower interest rate and improve your savings. You can use the personal loan balance transfer calculator and take your decision to move from one lender to another.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Personal Loan Balance Transfer Benefits</h2>
            <p>Some of the key benefits of a personal loan balance transfer are as follows:</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Improved Rate of Interest</h2>
            <p>The best advantage of opting for a personal loan balance transfer is to transfer the remaining loan amount at a low-interest rate. This reduces your overall EMI. However, it is suggested that you compare the interest rates and other charges for the balance transfer facility.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Chance to get a Longer Tenure</h2>
            <p>You can reduce your monthly burden of EMIs and ask a new lender to increase your tenure. However, the loan period for repayment will attract a higher interest payout. Keep in mind that a personal loan is offered generally with only tenure of up to 60 months. So, ensure you do not exceed that.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Better Features</h2>
            <p>If you have an adequate history of repayments, a new lender can offer you extra benefits as well, like no processing fee, waiver of the last EMI, insurance cover and many others.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Top-up Facility on Loan</h2>
            <p>You can ask for some more loan amount during the personal loan balance transfer with a top-up loan facility. However, this offer is valid only if you want to transfer the outstanding loan from the current lender to a different one.</p>

            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Factors Affecting Personal Loan Balance Transfer</h2>
            <p>Determine the following factors that can affect your personal loan balance transfer:</p>
            <h3>Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI)</h3>
            <p>People mainly transfer their balance to a new lender when they get lower interest rates in other banks. However, while transferring the remaining of your personal loan amount, you must ensure that your new lender agrees with the initial tenure. An extended repayment period may lead to an overall higher interest.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Processing Fee</h2>
            <p>There is a high chance that your new lender might charge you a processing fee. This may be of the same amount as charged by your previous lender. Whatever the case, ensure that this additional cost does not incur any losses.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Additional Offers</h2>
            <p>Check for or ask your lender about the availability of discounts while choosing a personal loan balance transfer, as this would further help reduce your loan burden.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Terms and Conditions</h2>
            <p>Make sure to read all the terms and conditions set by your new lender carefully. Clear all your doubts and ensure there are no hidden clauses that can damage your financial prospects.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Bank Transfer</h2>
            <p>If you don’t have a savings account with your new lender, it is possible that they might ask you to open a new bank account for a personal loan balance transfer. This can cost you some additional amount. Thus, you must transfer your personal loan to a bank where you already have a bank account.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Comparison of Personal Loans Interest Rate Offered by Top Banks/NBFCs</h2>
