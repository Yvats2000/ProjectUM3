            <p>Save the interest amount and live your life swiftly without any stress! Prepayment of a personal loan simply means paying the principal amount before completing your loan tenure. You can partially or completely pay the principal amount.</p>
            <p>You can also use the UrbanMoney personal loan prepayment calculator for understanding the EMI, the interest rate of prepayment, and other mandatory factors.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Personal Loan Prepayment Calculator Benefits</h2>
            <p>The personal loan prepayment calculator benefits are as follows:</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Free from Debt Easily</h2>
            <p>To live a debt-free life without any stress, you can collect some amount and deposit it as a prepayment of the principal amount of your loan. Prepayment of personal loans also helps reduce EMI costs as the principal amount will be reduced by some percentage.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Lower the Burden</h2>
            <p>Prepayment of personal loans does not mean that you have to pay the complete amount at once. You can prepay your loan amount partially as well. Though you won&apos;t be able to save any amount on the interest, the debt will be a lot less that way. Prepaying your outstanding loan also decreases the unpaid principal amount. Thus, the EMIs will be down on the prevailing interest amount.</p>

            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Save on Interest Amount</h2>
            <p>You must have sufficient funds to repay the complete loan amount in the earlier days of your tenure. Most banks and financial institutions have a one year lock-in period. It means that you cannot repay your loan amount partially or completely for a year. However, once the one year period is over, you can prepay the outstanding loan and save a good amount.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">How Does a Personal Loan Prepayment Calculator Work?</h2>
            <p>A personal loan EMI calculator with prepayment helps revise the loan prerequisite of EMI. The prepayment personal loan calculator requires you to enter the loan amount, the tenure, and interest rates in its required fields.</p>
            <p>If you are already repaying for a personal loan, the personal loan prepayment calculator would require the remaining loan amount, EMIs paid to date, the prepayment amount, interest rate, and tenure of your loan. You will learn how much money you will save on the EMIs using a personal loan EMI calculator with a prepayment option.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">How to Use the Urban Money Prepayment Calculator?</h2>

            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Factors Affecting Personal Loan Prepayment</h2>
            <p>The factors affecting personal loan prepayment are as follows:</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Tax Benefits</h2>
            <p>The Income Tax Act, under Section 80C, allows Rs. 1.5 lakh from tax deduction annually. However, if you are doing full prepayment, you won&apos;t be able to avail any tax benefit. But, if you opt for partial prepayment, the tax benefits will decrease considerably.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Rate of Interest</h2>
            <p>The interest rate on personal loans is higher than that of home loans. This is why it is advisable to prepay the principal amount of your personal loan. You can use the personal loan prepayment calculator and calculate the rate of interest e to pay either partial prepayment or full to free yourself from debts.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Ideal Time in the Tenure</h2>
            <p>Prepayment of personal loans reduces the interest being charged on your principal amount. You can easily use the prepayment calculator for personal loans and see the outflow of interest. However, the interest will be higher in the initial years of your loan tenure. Thus, you must prepay the loan in the initial years. Also, if you prepay the amounts later, you won&apos;t be able to enjoy several benefits.</p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Charges Levied on Prepayment</h2>
            <p>If you prepay the principal amount, you will be charged 2% extra for the prepayment. Banks and other financial institutions levy these charges to safeguard them from the loss of interest they would have earned in the future. </p>
