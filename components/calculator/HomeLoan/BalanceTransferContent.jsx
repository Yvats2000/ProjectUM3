                <span>Check New Lender’s Performance History [Interest Rate]</span><br />
                <p>Begin by looking at the lender&apos;s previous interest rate performance. Find out if the advertised interest rate is for a limited time or if they only offer loans at the listed interest rates. Don&apos;t get caught up in a marketing ploy.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Be Assured about the Service Quality of the New Lender</span><br />
                <p>Check to see if the chosen bank&apos;s service quality meets your expectations. It&apos;s not worth it to get a cheaper interest rate on a balance transfer home loan at the expense of poor service.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Examine the Benchmark Rate</span><br />
                <p>Refer home loan balance transfer charges RBI guidelines and current Repo Rate as they are more specific for home loans in contrast to PLR and MCLR. Access more transparency and low-interest home loans with schemes related to Repo Rate.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Variable or Fixed Spread</span><br />
                <p>Floating rate loans have two components to their interest rate. One is the benchmark rate, while the other is the spread above it. The benchmark rate fluctuates over time, but the spread remains constant. Many banks leave both components open-ended, resulting in a rapid spike in interest rates. Thus, avoid banks considering variable spreads.</p>
