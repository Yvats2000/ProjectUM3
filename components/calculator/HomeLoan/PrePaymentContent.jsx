            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">What are the Benefits of the Home Loan Part Payment Calculator?</h2>
            <p>Part-payment allows home loan borrowers to diminish the outstanding amount up to a significant level. This reduction in principal is reflected directly in decreased interest liabilities along with subsequent EMI reduction. A part-payment can be helpful in limiting the liabilities, especially when chosen at the right time. The part prepayment calculator enables you to depict the profitability of the upfront payment you will make against the house loan liability.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the part payment contributes to the overall improvement of the applicant’s credit score after the final settlement of the home loan. When you select the prepayment option, you take one more step towards easier principal amount repayment. Additionally, the charged interest rate remains in check. The best part about computing values is that you already know the exact savings you are going to unlock. </p>
            <p>As a home loan borrower, always try to make multiple partial payments across the loan tenure to avail of maximum benefits. Banks and lenders usually allow the borrower to make part prepayments equal to the amount payable through three EMIs. In simple words, if you are paying an EMI of INR 20,000, then you are eligible to make a part payment of INR 60,000. </p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Who is an Eligible Candidate to Make a Home Loan Prepayment?</h2>
            <p>Any home loan borrower is permitted to make full and partial prepayments towards the outstanding home loan amount. Well, there might be some restrictions that thoroughly depend upon your lender. Many lenders do not accept partial prepayments, while others do.</p>
            <p>Thus, it is highly recommended to go through the prepayment clause mentioned within the agreement before signing the home loan agreement. If your agreement permits you to do the same, then you are eligible to make part prepayments. Don’t forget to check if the lender has imposed any charges for prepayments. It is better to know about the penalty in advance before making partial payments. </p>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">What are the Applicable Home Loan Prepayment Charges?</h2>

These charges are imposed based on RBI guidelines or guidelines issued by central banks. All banks and housing finance companies are bound to follow these guidelines. If you are thinking of making partial prepayments, here are certain things you must be familiar with:</p>
            <p>When Banks & HFCs are Permitted to Charge Prepayment Penalties</p>
            <ul className="oList blueList listSpanbold mb20">
              <li>If a non-individual borrower applies for partial prepayments, then he/she will be liable to pay a prepayment penalty.</li>

              <li>HFCs are restricted from imposing penalties on borrowers with fixed rates only if the borrower applies for another loan to put forward the prepayment.</li>
              <li>If the individual who accessed a dual-rate loan decides to make a prepayment during the fixed rate tenure, then he will be liable to pay a penalty.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="fontStyleItalic"><span className="fontBold">Note:</span> A dual-rate loan is one in which the rate was initially fixed but after a certain time period was shifted to floating interest rates.</p>
            <p>Cases in Which HFCs are not Permitted to Charge Prepayment Penalties </p>
            <ul className="oList blueList listSpanbold mb20">

            </ul>
            <h2 className="mt30 mb15 font18 text181d fontMedium">Factors to Consider Before Making Part Prepayments</h2>
            <p>It is not advisable to make part prepayments out of the blue. You need to go through a systematic procedure if you want to avail the maximum possible benefits. Certain factors account for the right time to make a prepayment. </p>
            <h3 className="font14 mb0 text444 fontBold mt0">1. The Age of the Borrower:</h3>
            <p>
              If the applicant is near retirement age, then count on the prepayment prior to retirement. When you reach retirement, your income sources are restricted, and your expenditure might increase. There are chances that you won’t be able to make a part prepayment after getting retired.
            </p>
            <h3 className="font14 mb0 text444 fontBold mt0">2. Future Expenditure:</h3>
            <p>
              When you finalise the part prepayment, don’t skip contemplating the upcoming expenses. The amount you will prepay is a huge amount and can literally exhaust all accumulated amounts. Thus, before making such payments, look into your finances and plan accordingly. 
            </p>
            <h3 className="font14 mb0 text444 fontBold mt0">3. Tax Savings:</h3>
            <p>
              When an applicant makes a home part prepayment, he is rolled off the list of possible tax benefits. whereas during the repayment period, you can claim a maximum tax exemption of INR 1.5 lakh on the principal component under Section 80C. Furthermore, under Section 24 (b), you can claim a maximum tax exemption of INR 2 lakh on the interest component. In the case of a joint loan, both the owners can avail the benefits of the tax exemption individually. 
            </p>
            <h3 className="font14 mb0 text444 fontBold mt0">4. Total Savings Achieved Through Prepayment</h3>
            <p>
              You might have to pay a liable fee to avail yourself of the benefits of prepayment. Before you consider part prepayment, look into the applicable charges, if any, along with the overall amount you will save by making prepayment of a home loan. If you don’t make huge savings through loan prepayment, then drop the idea of prepayment. Additionally, you should consider making a prepayment in the later stages of repayment tenure as the principal component is higher. In the initial tenure, the principal component is comparatively low. 
            </p>
            <h3 className="font14 mb0 text444 fontBold mt0">5. Investment opportunities</h3>
            <p>
              When you have access to a reliable amount of funds, don’t just look into prepayments. If you get other opportunities to invest the same amount and can avail more benefits through the investment, then you should consider other opportunities over prepayment of your home loan.
